## kCantonese
### Description
> The most customary jyutping (Cantonese) reading for this character.

> This field is targeted specifically for use by CLDR collation and transliteration. As such, it is subject to considerations that help keep jyutping-based Han collation (and its tailorings) and transliteration reasonably stable. The values may not in all cases track the preferred reading in some dictionaries.

This is an abridged entry.  For sources, see the `kCantonese` [entry](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr38/#kCantonese) in Annex #38.

## kHanyuPinlu
### Description
> The Pronunciations and Frequencies of this character, based in part on those appearing in 《現代漢語頻率詞典》 <Xiandai Hanyu Pinlu Cidian> (XDHYPLCD) [Modern Standard Beijing Chinese Frequency Dictionary] (complete bibliographic information below).

> This dataset contains a total of 3799 records. (The original data provided to Unihan 2003/02/04 contained a total of 3800 records, including 〇 [U+3007] líng ‘IDEOGRAPHIC NUMBER ZERO’, not included in Unihan since it is not a CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH.)

> Each entry is comprised of two pieces of data. The Hanyu Pinyin (HYPY) pronunciation(s) of the character. Immediately following the pronunciation, a numeric string appears in parentheses: for example, in “ā(392)” the numeric string “392” indicates the sum total of the frequencies of the pronunciations of the character as given in HYPLCD.

> Where more than one pronunciation exists, these are sorted by descending frequency, and the list elements are “space” delimited.

## kHanyuPinyin
### Description
> The 漢語拼音 Hànyǔ Pīnyīn reading(s) appearing in the edition of 《漢語大字典》 Hànyǔ Dà Zìdiǎn (HDZ) specified in the “kHanYu” property description (q.v.). Each location has the form “ABCDE.XYZ” (as in “kHanYu”); multiple locations for a given pīnyīn reading are separated by commas. The list of locations is followed by a colon, followed by a comma-separated list of one or more pīnyīn readings. Where multiple pīnyīn readings are associated with a given mapping, these are ordered as in HDZ (for the most part reflecting relative commonality). The following are representative records.

> | U+34CE | 㓎 | 10297.260: qīn,qìn,qǐn | | U+34D8 | 㓘 | 10278.080,10278.090: sù | | U+5364 | 卤 | 10093.130: xī,lǔ 74609.020: lǔ,xī | | U+5EFE | 廾 | 10513.110,10514.010,10514.020: gǒng |

> For example, the “kHanyuPinyin” value for 卤 U+5364 is “10093.130: xī,lǔ 74609.020: lǔ,xī”. This means that 卤 U+5364 is found in “kHanYu” at entries 10093.130 and 74609.020. The former entry has the two pīnyīn readings xī and lǔ (in that order), whereas the latter entry has the readings lǔ and xī (reversing the order).

> This data was originally input by 井作恆 Jǐng Zuòhéng, proofed by 聃媽歌 Dān Māgē (Magda Danish, using software donated by 文林 Wénlín Institute, Inc. and tables prepared by 曲理查 Qū Lǐchá), and proofed again and prepared for the Unicode Consortium by 曲理查 Qū Lǐchá (2008-01-14).

> -- Release Notes --
> This data set includes readings for 34,130 distinct HDZ Hànzì, 34,302 HDZ references, and 1,457 distinct pīnyīn syllables.
